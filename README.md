# RaspbianUIBuild
Hello!
Here's what I've been working on for some time, and the idea is that it looks like the UI of Raspbian (the default Respberry Pi operating system). If you feel like it, you can go to the Web Browser simulation by clicking on the globe wireframe. You can go through some of the bookmarks here, add tabs, search some things up in the Google search bar, go to different HTTPS webpages in the top search bar, etc.
